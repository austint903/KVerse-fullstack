# KVerse-fullstack

Hello! This is my first fullstack project. This web app is called KVerse and is intended for a fun way to learn Korean through the rise in popularity of Kpop songs. 

This app features the use of Python's Django framework for the backend, and React.js for the frontend. The app includes features such as user authentication with JSON tokens, and an interactive AI chatbot done through the OllamaLLM API. ðŸ˜€
